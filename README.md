# Hypothyroid Prediction with Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict hypothyroidism, a common endocrine disorder, using clinical data.

### Dataset

Dataset includes 3,772 instances with 29 features and a binary class indicating the presence of the disease.

### Preprocessing

The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values (KNN imputation) and categorical variables (encoding). Class imbalance was addressed using SMOTE.

### Models

Evaluated Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and K-NN for their predictive capabilities.

### Performance

Random Forest outperformed other models with 99.94% accuracy, 100% precision, and recall, and an F1 score of 100%.

### Conclusion

Machine learning shows promise in early hypothyroidism detection, with Random Forest being highly effective.
